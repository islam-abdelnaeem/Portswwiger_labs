# SQL Injection Lab Write-Up: Retrieving Hidden Data ## Lab Overview This write-up documents my solution to the **"SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data"** lab from PortSwigger's Web Security Academy. The goal of this lab is to exploit an SQL injection vulnerability to retrieve all products, including those not meant to be displayed in a specific category. ## Objective The objective is to bypass the application's filtering mechanism and retrieve hidden data (products) from the database by injecting malicious SQL code into a vulnerable parameter. ## Steps to Solve ### 1. Exploring the Application - I started by interacting with the web application to understand how it works. - The application has a product listing page with a category filter (e.g., "Gifts," "Accessories"). - Clicking on a category sends a request to the server, likely querying a database to fetch products in that category. ### 2. Identifying the Vulnerable Parameter - I tested different parts of the application to find a parameter that interacts with the database and returns data. - After some trial and error, I noticed the URL structure when selecting a category: https://example.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=Gifts. - The category parameter seemed promising because it likely gets inserted into an SQL query to filter products. ### 3. Testing for SQL Injection - To confirm if the category parameter is vulnerable, I modified the input to include a simple SQL injection payload. - I replaced Gifts with the following payload: ' OR '1'='1. - The full URL became: https://example.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=' OR '1'='1. - After submitting this, the page returall productsts** from the database, not just those in a specific category. ### 4. Understanding the Payload - The payload ' OR '1'='1 works by altering the SQL query's logic: - Original query (assumed): SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts'; - Modified query after injection: SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '' OR '1'='1'; - The condition '1'='1' is always true, so the query returns all rows from the products table. ### 5. Solving the Lab - Submitting the payload successfully displayed all hidden products, completing the lab's objective. ## Payload Used ' OR '1'='1 ## Lessons Learned - SQL injection vulnerabilities occur when user input is not properly sanitized before being included in a database query. - Simple payloads like ' OR '1'='1 can bypass weak input validation and expose sensitive data. - Testing different parameters systematically is key to identifying injection points. ## Recommendations - Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) to prevent SQL injection. - Sanitize and validate all user inputs on the server side. ## Conclusion This lab was a great introduction to SQL injection. By experimenting with the category parameter and crafting a basic payload, I was able to retrieve hidden data from the database. This exercise highlights the importance of secure coding practices in web development.
